doc: display the documentation already

Currently, use Emacs as a standalone info reader (including man pages).

It would be nice to extend this to other forms of documentation (text,
HTML, PDF), other backends (less, browsers), and other documentation
cataloging systems (Debian doc-central, scrollkeeper &c.)
